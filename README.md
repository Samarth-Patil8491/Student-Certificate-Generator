**Student Certificate Management System (C++)
📌 Overview**

This project is a Student Certificate Management System built using C++ and STL. It allows users to input student details, subject information, internal and theory marks, automatically calculate totals, percentages, grades, and generate a well-formatted student report/certificate.

**The program supports generating certificates for multiple students in a single run.**

**🎯 Features**

Store complete student details (name, roll no, registration no, school, parents, DOB, gender)

Handle multiple subjects per student

**Calculate:**

Subject-wise total marks

Grades based on marks

Overall total and percentage

Generate formatted certificates for all students

Uses OOP concepts and STL vectors

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

C++

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

STL (vector)

Console-based I/O

**📂 How the Program Works**

User enters the number of students.

For each student:

Personal details are collected.

Subject codes, names, theory marks, and IA marks are entered.

The program:

Calculates total marks and percentage.

Assigns grades automatically.

Finally, certificates for all students are printed in a structured format.

📊 **Grading System**

**Marks Range	Grade**
90+	A+
80–89	A
70–79	B+
60–69	B
50–59	C
40–49	D
< 40	F


**🚀 How to Run**
g++ student_certificate.cpp -o student_certificate
./student_certificate

**🧠 Learning Outcomes**

Strong understanding of classes and objects

Working with dynamic data using vectors

Implementing real-world logic (grading & reports)

Clean console output formatting

**🔮 Future Enhancements**

File storage (save certificates to file)

Search student by roll number

Menu-driven interface

GUI version

Database integration
